## Current position

Milestone 1. Runnable: Vault/CLI core; Folder, GitHub and direct local MarginNote 4 sources; builtin
interaction memory with quarantined MCP proposals; bilingual SQLite/FTS; bounded Context API; MCP
STDIO; Claude/Codex adapters; owner-readable Profile export; the Plugin Advisor; privacy
inventory/purge with atomic chain-preserving restore; digest-bound guided setup through doctor and
smoke; verified owner backup/restore; hosted CI/supply-chain gates; the accepted versioned
production evaluation harness; four executable post-contract agent skills; and the exact frozen
Claude/Codex real-host S12 journeys. Milestone 1 is complete. Aptuni 0.1.0 is public on PyPI and as a
GitHub Release from exact commit `33ea08a`; tag workflow 35619712980 and release-commit CI
35572245440 are green. Review 50 independently approved the final public result.

## Read first

1. `AGENTS.md`, `STATE.md` (next tasks), `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `BACKLOG.md`
2. `DECISIONS/` for the area you touch; `docs/research/INDEX.md` and `findings/pitfalls.md`
3. `docs/brand/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md` before README, docs or UI work

## Next action

Open Milestone 2 with the KI-008/S10 Mem0 local privacy, retention and export isolation prerequisite.
Write and accept a bounded TDD plan and fixture before beginning an adapter. Do not mutate the
0.1.0 tag or artifacts; a concrete public defect requires a patch release.

`docs/dev/plans/07-m1-exit-matrix.md` audits every remaining M1 exit clause and orders Slices 14–18.
Keep all MarginNote access read-only; never commit note text, and do not infer release authorization.

### What just landed

Slice 17's daily-task and focused matrices pass on Claude Code 2.1.267/2.1.266 and Codex
0.155.0/0.154.0. Exact resolved versions and the external built-wheel runtime are enforced. Claude
did not emit focused file-tool calls, so no denial is claimed; both Apple Event attempts produced no
outer effect and status remains `unverified`. Full local gate: 459 tests plus 47 subtests, ruff,
strict mypy, relay and 34 developer checks clean. Review 48 is **APPROVE**.

The pushed checkpoint passed hosted macOS, Ubuntu (including ext4 durability) and build/supply-chain
jobs. A 2026-09-21 read-only audit found no `aptuni` package on PyPI or npm, found only
`ruihaomei/aptuni` as an exact-name GitHub repository, and confirmed private vulnerability reporting
is enabled. No registry or repository setting was changed.

The exact 0.1.0 release commit is `33ea08a54a0a26a1dcfa74c419121afebe31f4c0`, tagged `v0.1.0`.
The OIDC release workflow passed and published byte-identical artifacts to PyPI; the GitHub Release
adds the same wheel/sdist and `SHA256SUMS`. A fresh PyPI-only Python 3.13 install passed CLI,
synthetic Vault/context/setup and MCP safety smokes. Legal files, public links, package metadata,
secret/private-data scans and the zero-finding hosted vulnerability audit passed. Review 50 is
**APPROVE**. See `docs/dev/releases/0.1.0.md` for exact URLs, run IDs and hashes.

## Known constraints

- The maintainer authorized the final 0.1.0 release-record checkpoint and push. Future publication
  or tag changes require fresh authorization. Toolchain: `.tools/bin/uv` (bootstrap in AGENTS.md).
- `Prompt_PRD.txt` and the design-history file are maintainer-private and gitignored;
  `docs/product/PRD.md` is canonical.
- Product/repository name Aptuni and `@ruihaomei` CODEOWNER are fixed. Private vulnerability
  reporting and name collision checks are release gates, not current blockers.
