## Current position

Milestone 1. Runnable: Vault/CLI core; Folder, GitHub and direct local MarginNote 4 sources; builtin
interaction memory with quarantined MCP proposals; bilingual SQLite/FTS; bounded Context API; MCP
STDIO; Claude/Codex adapters; owner-readable Profile export; and the Plugin Advisor. MarginNote review
25, memory re-review 28 and export review 27 are approved with non-blocking notes. Nothing is pushed.

## Read first

1. `AGENTS.md`, `STATE.md` (next tasks), `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `BACKLOG.md`
2. `DECISIONS/` for the area you touch; `docs/research/INDEX.md` and `findings/pitfalls.md`
3. `docs/brand/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md` before README, docs or UI work

## Next action

Checkpoint the current slices, then implement the ADR-0010 privacy inventory/purge application slice
before guided-setup apply. Details and remaining M1 exit gates are in STATE "Next highest-priority
task". Keep all MarginNote access read-only; never commit note text.

## Known constraints

- Commits are local only; never push. Toolchain: `.tools/bin/uv` (bootstrap in AGENTS.md).
- `Prompt_PRD.txt` and the design-history file are maintainer-private and gitignored;
  `docs/product/PRD.md` is canonical.
- Product/repository name Aptuni and `@ruihaomei` CODEOWNER are fixed. Private vulnerability
  reporting and name collision checks are release gates, not current blockers.
