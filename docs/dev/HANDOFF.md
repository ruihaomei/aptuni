## Current position

Milestone 1. Runnable: Vault/CLI core; Folder, GitHub and direct local MarginNote 4 sources; builtin
interaction memory with quarantined MCP proposals; bilingual SQLite/FTS; bounded Context API; MCP
STDIO; Claude/Codex adapters; owner-readable Profile export; the Plugin Advisor; privacy
inventory/purge with atomic chain-preserving restore; digest-bound guided setup through doctor and
smoke; verified owner backup/restore; hosted CI/supply-chain gates; the accepted versioned
production evaluation harness; four executable post-contract agent skills; and the exact frozen
Claude/Codex real-host S12 journeys. Slice 17 is complete and Review 48 is **APPROVE**. Public
`origin/main` remains at `c86e861` until the authorized three-checkpoint push.

## Read first

1. `AGENTS.md`, `STATE.md` (next tasks), `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `BACKLOG.md`
2. `DECISIONS/` for the area you touch; `docs/research/INDEX.md` and `findings/pitfalls.md`
3. `docs/brand/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md` before README, docs or UI work

## Next action

Commit the final Slice 17 checkpoint, push the three local commits to `origin/main`, and verify the
hosted workflow. Then perform only the read-only release-readiness checks named in `STATE.md`; do not
publish, tag, upload packages or mutate repository settings without maintainer authorization.

`docs/dev/plans/07-m1-exit-matrix.md` audits every remaining M1 exit clause and orders Slices 14–18.
Keep all MarginNote access read-only; never commit note text, and do not infer release authorization.

### What just landed

Slice 17's daily-task and focused matrices pass on Claude Code 2.1.267/2.1.266 and Codex
0.155.0/0.154.0. Exact resolved versions and the external built-wheel runtime are enforced. Claude
did not emit focused file-tool calls, so no denial is claimed; both Apple Event attempts produced no
outer effect and status remains `unverified`. Full local gate: 459 tests plus 47 subtests, ruff,
strict mypy, relay and 34 developer checks clean. Review 48 is **APPROVE**.

## Known constraints

- Do not push new commits without a fresh maintainer instruction. Toolchain: `.tools/bin/uv`
  (bootstrap in AGENTS.md).
- `Prompt_PRD.txt` and the design-history file are maintainer-private and gitignored;
  `docs/product/PRD.md` is canonical.
- Product/repository name Aptuni and `@ruihaomei` CODEOWNER are fixed. Private vulnerability
  reporting and name collision checks are release gates, not current blockers.
