## Current position

Milestone 1. Runnable: Vault/CLI core; Folder, GitHub and direct local MarginNote 4 sources; builtin
interaction memory with quarantined MCP proposals; bilingual SQLite/FTS; bounded Context API; MCP
STDIO; Claude/Codex adapters; owner-readable Profile export; the Plugin Advisor; privacy
inventory/purge with atomic chain-preserving restore; digest-bound guided setup through doctor and
smoke; verified owner backup/restore; hosted CI/supply-chain gates; the accepted versioned
production evaluation harness; four executable post-contract agent skills; and the exact frozen
Claude/Codex real-host S12 journeys. Slice 17 is complete and Review 48 is **APPROVE**. Public
`origin/main` is at `1f14e29`; hosted CI run `35550733889` is green.

## Read first

1. `AGENTS.md`, `STATE.md` (next tasks), `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `BACKLOG.md`
2. `DECISIONS/` for the area you touch; `docs/research/INDEX.md` and `findings/pitfalls.md`
3. `docs/brand/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md` before README, docs or UI work

## Next action

Complete the authorized 0.1.0 publication: register the pending PyPI trusted publisher, push the
reviewed release commit, wait for hosted `main` CI, create/push `v0.1.0`, verify the PyPI OIDC tag
workflow, create the GitHub Release, run public-install smokes, and obtain final independent review.

`docs/dev/plans/07-m1-exit-matrix.md` audits every remaining M1 exit clause and orders Slices 14–18.
Keep all MarginNote access read-only; never commit note text, and do not infer release authorization.

### What just landed

Slice 17's daily-task and focused matrices pass on Claude Code 2.1.267/2.1.266 and Codex
0.155.0/0.154.0. Exact resolved versions and the external built-wheel runtime are enforced. Claude
did not emit focused file-tool calls, so no denial is claimed; both Apple Event attempts produced no
outer effect and status remains `unverified`. Full local gate: 459 tests plus 47 subtests, ruff,
strict mypy, relay and 34 developer checks clean. Review 48 is **APPROVE**.

The pushed checkpoint passed hosted macOS, Ubuntu (including ext4 durability) and build/supply-chain
jobs. A 2026-09-21 read-only audit found no `aptuni` package on PyPI or npm, found only
`ruihaomei/aptuni` as an exact-name GitHub repository, and confirmed private vulnerability reporting
is enabled. No registry or repository setting was changed.

The 0.1.0 release candidate aligns version, changelog, citation, security, compatibility and public
installation surfaces. Its tag-only OIDC workflow builds twice, audits and smokes the exact artifact
before granting only the isolated `pypi` job a short-lived publish identity. Full local gates passed;
independent Review 49 is **APPROVE**.

## Known constraints

- Do not push new commits without a fresh maintainer instruction. Toolchain: `.tools/bin/uv`
  (bootstrap in AGENTS.md).
- `Prompt_PRD.txt` and the design-history file are maintainer-private and gitignored;
  `docs/product/PRD.md` is canonical.
- Product/repository name Aptuni and `@ruihaomei` CODEOWNER are fixed. Private vulnerability
  reporting and name collision checks are release gates, not current blockers.
