# Handoff

Review status manifest: architecture=APPROVE_WITH_NON_BLOCKING_NOTES; execution=APPROVE_WITH_NON_BLOCKING_NOTES; gate0-exit=APPROVE_WITH_NON_BLOCKING_NOTES; relay-claude-code=PASS; relay-codex=PASS; security=APPROVE_WITH_NON_BLOCKING_NOTES

## Current position

Gate 0 is closed (review 15; all ADRs accepted). Milestone 1 is under way in `src/aptuni/`, following
the AGENTS.md execution policy: runnable vertical slices, with independent review only for
high-risk changes.

## Read first

1. `AGENTS.md` (execution policy), `STATE.md`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `BACKLOG.md`
2. `DECISIONS/` for the area you touch; `docs/research/INDEX.md` before any research
3. `docs/brand/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md` before README, docs or UI work

## Next action

Continue M1 in order: Vault/init → Folder Source → SQLite/FTS → Context API → CLI → MCP →
Claude/Codex adapters → MarginNote/GitHub → Recipes/i18n.

## Known constraints

- Commits are local only; never push. Toolchain: `.tools/bin/uv` (bootstrap in AGENTS.md).
- `Prompt_PRD.txt` and the design-history file are maintainer-private and gitignored;
  `docs/product/PRD.md` is canonical.
- Pre-rewrite backup bundle: session scratchpad only (not in the repo).
